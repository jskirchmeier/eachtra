# A New Beginning

After several fitful starts and with a pile of discarded bits on the floor of the workroom our adventure
can now start in ernest.  Since this endeavor is more about process than the program itself, lets cover some
of the decisions that were made (and in some cases discarded) and how we got to this starting point.

### Command Line Interface
Since starting in Golang some years ago every command line interface I've written has been done 
using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), a great tool to create command driven CLIs.

I've gone with having the CLI (and the main package) in the root directory, with all code below it.
